A collection of premier tools for CCP Games' [Eve Online](http://eveonline.com).

## Contributing
Open-source projects are specifically designed to be community driven, giving us an opportunity to not only create a series tools that are exactly what the community wants. Nothing to hide, everything to show for.

While we are happy to take community contributions to Tech-3, there are a few guidelines we ask you follow, however.
- Maintain the current code style of Tech-3. CodeClimate should give you an A.
- CodeClimate should not raise any issues other than TODOs (safe to ignore) and `Parser Error` (special cases).
- The build through Travis must pass. (If you introduce any new modules, please create tests for them)
- Be aware that all code you submit to Tech-3 belongs to Tech-3 (and is therefore under Tech-3's open-source license) after the request is merged.
